# Using Valgrind to Debug a C Project

## 1. Compiling with GCC

Before using Valgrind, make sure to compile your project with the appropriate flags to include debugging information.

```bash
gcc -g -ggdb3 -o my_project my_project.c
```

The `-g` and `-ggdb3` options add debugging information to the executable, which will make it easier to analyze with Valgrind.

## 2. Introduction to Valgrind

Valgrind is a tool that helps detect several types of errors in your program, such as:
- Memory leaks
- Invalid memory access (invalid read/write)
- Segmentation faults (segfault)

## 3. Basic Usage

### Running Valgrind on a Program

To run a program with Valgrind, use the following command:

```bash
valgrind ./my_project
```

### Checking for Memory Leaks

To detect memory leaks, run this command:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_project
```

This will show where memory was allocated but never freed.

### Detecting Invalid Reads

If your program tries to read outside of allocated memory, Valgrind will flag it as an "Invalid read" error. For example:

```bash
valgrind ./my_project
```

### Detecting Segfaults

Valgrind can help track down the cause of a **segfault** (segmentation fault). Just run your program with Valgrind, and it will tell you where the error occurs:

```bash
valgrind ./my_project
```

## 4. Example of a Program with a Segfault

Here is an example of a C program that causes a **segfault** by attempting to write to a read-only string.

### Code (my_project.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *str = "Hello";
    str[0] = 'h'; // Attempt to modify a constant string (causes a segfault)
    printf("%s\n", str);
    return 0;
}
```

### Running the Program (Without Valgrind)

Let's compile and run this program without Valgrind first to see the behavior.

```bash
$ gcc -o my_project my_project.c
$ ./my_project
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

The program crashes with a **segmentation fault** when trying to modify the string.

### Running with Valgrind

Now, let's compile it with debugging flags and use Valgrind to investigate the cause of the error.

```bash
$ gcc -g -ggdb3 -o my_project my_project.c
$ valgrind ./my_project
```

Example output:

```

### Key Information

Valgrind indicates that the **Invalid write** occurs at line 5 in the file `my_project.c`. It also shows that the memory at that address is in a read-only segment, which explains the cause of the segmentation fault.

## 5. Additional Resources

Valgrind has its own manual that you can refer to for more details:

```bash
man valgrind
```

Be sure to explore the GCC manual as well:

```bash
man gcc
```
